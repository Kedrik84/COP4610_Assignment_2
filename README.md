### Programming Homework 2
 

#### General Grading Guidelines:

The following deductions will apply to all programming assignments.

1. Any program that does not compile will result in a zero for the assignment. No exceptions will be made for ‘accidental’ uploads, so check your code before submitting.
2. Poor Formatting and programming style will result in a 15% deduction. Please see the style guidelines to avoid this deduction.
3. The code will go through 2 steps of plagiarism detection. Zero tolerance for academic misconduct!  If you commit any form of academic misconduct in this course, you WILL be reported to the FIU Student Conduct and Academic Affairs office.

#### Programming Style Guidelines:

The major purpose of programming style guidelines is to make programs easy to read and understand. Good programming style helps make it possible for a person knowledgeable in the application area to quickly read a program and understand how it works.

1. Your program should begin with a comment that briefly summarizes what it does. For this course, this comment should also include your Name and pantherID.
2. Use additional comments when needed in order for a reader to understand what is happening (see also, point 3).
3. Variable names and function names should be sufficiently descriptive so that a knowledgeable reader can easily understand what the variable means and what the function does. If this is not possible, comments should be added to make the meaning clear.
4. Use consistent indentation to emphasize block structure.
5. Use names of moderate length for variables. Most names should be between 2 and 12 letters long.
6. Use either underscores or capitalization (camelNaming) for compound names for variables. e.g: tot_vol, total_volumn, or totalVolumn. 
 

#### Objective
Study the impact of different scheduling algorithms on the average turnaround time of concurrent processes.

## Description
A simulation mimics the execution of n different processes under different scheduling algorithms. The simulation maintains a table that reflects the current state of the system:
